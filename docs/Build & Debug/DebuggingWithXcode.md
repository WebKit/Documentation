# Debugging With Xcode

You can use Xcode to build & debug WebKit. Open `WebKit.xcworkspace` at the top level directory.

In order to make Xcode use build files built by `make` command above,
go to File > Workspace Settings... > Advanced... > Custom > Relative to Workspace
and adjust the relative paths of Products and Intermediates to point to `WebKitBuild` directory.

Note that debugging WebCore code typically requires attaching to the relevant WebContent process,
not the application process, which is mostly running code in [Source/WebKit/UIProcess](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/tree/main/Source/WebKit/UIProcess).
Depending on what you’re debugging, you’d have to attach & debug different processes in the coalition.

You may find it useful to use the debug helpers under `Tools/lldb/lldb_webkit.py`.
This can be added to `~/.lldbinit` for automatic loading into LLDB on launch by adding the line `command script import {Path to WebKit}/Tools/lldb/lldb_webkit.py`.
For more details, see the Wiki article on [lldb formatters](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/lldb%20formatters).

When debugging a debug build in LLDB, there are also a few functions that can be called on objects that will dump debugging info.

* RenderObject
    * showNodeTree()
    * showLineTree()
    * showRenderTree()
* Node
    * showTree()
    * showNodePath()
    * showTreeForThis()
    * showNodePathForThis()

## Debugging Layout Tests

The easiest way to debug a layout test is with WebKitTestRunner or DumpRenderTree.
In Product > Scheme, select “All Source”.

In Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme, open “Run” tab.
Pick WebKitTestRunner or DumpRenderTree, whichever is desired in “Executable”.

Go to Arguments and specify the path to the layout tests being debugged relative to where the build directory is located.
e.g. `../../LayoutTests/fast/dom/Element/element-traversal.html` if `WebKitBuild/Debug` is the build directory.

You may want to specify OS_ACTIVITY_MODE environmental variable to “disable”
in order to suppress all the system logging that happens during the debugging session.

You may also want to specify `--no-timeout` option to prevent WebKitTestRunner or DumpRenderTree
to stop the test after 30 seconds if you’re stepping through code.

Once this is done, you can run WebKitTestRunner or DumpRenderTree by going to Product > Perform Action > Run without Building.

Clicking on “Run” button may be significantly slower due to Xcode re-building every project and framework each time.
You can disable this behavior by going to “Build” tab and unchecking boxes for all the frameworks involved for “Run”:

### Attaching to WebContent Process

You may find Xcode fails to attach to WebContent or Networking process in the case of WebKitTestRunner.
In those cases, attach a breakpoint in UIProcess code
such as [`TestController::runTest` in WebKitTestRunner right before `TestInvocation::invoke` is called](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/5f4c01f41527547ce2f82b812ad478e12b51239d/Tools/WebKitTestRunner/TestController.cpp#L1522).
Once breakpoint is hit in the UIProcess, attach to `WebContent.Development` or `Networking.Development` process manually in Xcode via Debug > Attach to Process.
