# Garbage Collection

The JavaScriptCore Garbage Collector (JSC GC) in WebKit utilizes the [Riptide algorithm](https://webkit.org/blog/7122/introducing-riptide-webkits-retreating-wavefront-concurrent-garbage-collector/), an advanced and efficient memory management technique. Riptide is designed to manage memory for JavaScript objects in a way that minimizes interruptions to the running JavaScript code, improving the performance of web applications. This algorithm employs a combination of generational and concurrent garbage collection strategies, where objects are classified into different generations based on their age and usage patterns. Riptide optimizes the collection process by prioritizing younger objects for faster cleanup and concurrently collecting older objects, thereby reducing the time spent on garbage collection, enhancing the overall responsiveness and reliability of web applications. The Riptide algorithm is a critical component of WebKit's memory management system, ensuring that JavaScript code runs smoothly while efficiently managing memory resources.

## JavaScriptCore GC and C++ DOM Nodes

The JSC GC does not do any reference counting.  However, on the WebCore side, DOM nodes are ref counted.To manage the lifetimes of C++ DOM nodes, a reference counting mechanism is employed.When a C++ DOM node is created, its reference count is set to 1.When an external object or JavaScript code references a DOM node, its reference count is increased.When a reference is no longer needed, the reference count is decreased. When the reference count drops to 0, the DOM node is destroyed, freeing its associated memory.

The interplay between C++ DOM nodes and GC cells (used for JavaScript objects) arises from the potential for JavaScript objects to hold references to C++ DOM nodes. This interplay can create complex scenarios, such as:

### 1. JavaScript Objects Referencing DOM Nodes: 

 When a JavaScript object holds a reference to a DOM node, it effectively prevents the DOM node from being destroyed as long as the JavaScript object is in scope. This can lead to memory leaks if not managed correctly.

 

        // JavaScript object referencing a DOM node
        let button = document.getElementById('myButton');
        let jsObject = { element: button };

 
  

### 2. DOM Nodes Releasing JavaScript Objects:

The opposite situation is also possible. When a C++ DOM node is released by reference counting, it may result in JavaScript objects holding references to "dead" DOM nodes. Accessing these DOM nodes from JavaScript can lead to undefined behavior.


## JSC Debugging tools for the Garbage Collector

### 1. The GC Verifier:

enabled using the JSC_verifyGC and JSC_verboseVerifyGC options.  This tool runs a normal GC cycle, and then stops the world and run an simple stupid full GC cycle for verification.  And then the verifier compares the results of the 2 runs.  Any live cells found by the GC Verifier must also be found live by the normal GC.  OTOH, cells found live by the normal GC may be conservative, and is not actually live as seen by the GC Verifier.  This tool is a turn key solution that documents found issues for the user to diagnose.


### 2. The Heap Verifier:

 enabled using the JSC_verifyHeap option.  It implements hooks into the beginning and end of GC cycles, and performs custom analysis on the live cells found.  The user can enhance and tweak the Heap Verifier to detect various forms of corruption or patterns in cells in the cell graph.  The user can also use the Heap Verifier to detect which GC cycle a cell was born and died in for debugging liveness issues.  This tool is NOT a turn key solution.  It requires the user to know what they are looking for and building on the Heap Verifier as infrastructure / framework for debugging an issue.
