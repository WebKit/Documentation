# Build

The WebKit Build System

## Overview

WebKit can be built on a wide range of platforms and architectures. When performing a build on Apple platforms we use xcodebuild, and for non Apple platforms CMake is used instead.

To find specific instructions on different build options please reference #Fixme.
