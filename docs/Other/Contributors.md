# Contributors

## Overview

There are three different kinds of contributors in the WebKit project.

 * Contributor - This category encompasses everyone. Anyone who files a bug or contributes a code change or reviews a code change is considered as a contributor
 * Committer - A committer is someone who has write access to [WebKit's repository](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit).
 * Reviewer - A reviewer is someone who has the right to review and approve code changes other contributors proposed.

See [Commit and Review Policy](https://webkit.org/commit-and-review-policy/) for more details on how to become a committer or a reviewer.
