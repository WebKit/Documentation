Much of the code we inherited from [KHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML) is licensed under [LGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License).
New code contributed to WebKit will use the [two clause BSD license](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebCore/LICENSE-APPLE).
When contributing new code, update the copyright date.
When moving the existing code, you need to include the original copyright notice for the moved code
and you should also not change the license, which may be BSD or LGPL depending on a file, without the permission of the copyright holders.
