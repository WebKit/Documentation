# Web Template Framework

A standard C++ library for Web Engine Development

## Overview

Web Template Framework, more commonly known as WTF, contains a large number of general data structures and helper functions that are optimized for usage in WebKit. These are used quite heavily in the WebKit code base with the exception of bmalloc and libpas. bmalloc and libpas are the underpinning of many data structures used in WTF, and thus they maintain their own data structures separate from WTF.
